I often help people that are stuck trying to figure out how to do something in an app and not realizing they can click on something that gives no indication it's clickable is a common thing.<p>Desktop is another world.  I often have 20+ inches of horizontal space and a hamburger menu.  It's infuriating, especially when the hamburger menu is hiding <i>one</i> button.",
